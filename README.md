# Gitlab Git Hooks for Rally Integration

CA Agile Central is a highly used workflow and ticket management system that allows teams to track the progress of features within a project. I have worked with several teams that have used it and a few of them have used GitLab Enterprise for their version control.

There seems to be a large gap for automation and integration between these two pieces of software and this series of hooks is meant to correct that.
